# DarkFTP: FTP Vulnerability Scanner for Ethical Hacking

**DarkFTP** is a Python-based tool for penetration testers and ethical hackers to rapidly identify vulnerable FTP servers. It automates scanning for anonymous login, root/Administrator access, privilege escalation, FTP Bounce attacks, and recursive directory traversal, scoring high-value targets to prioritize fixes. Built for bulk IP analysis, DarkFTP empowers the ethical hacking community to secure systems before attackers exploit them.

> **Warning**: DarkFTP is for **authorized penetration testing only**. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical. Ensure explicit permission from system owners before scanning.

## Features

- **Anonymous Login Testing**: Validates `anonymous:root` access on FTP servers.
- **Root/Administrator Access Detection**: Tests access to sensitive directories (`/etc`, `/root`, `/Windows/System32`).
- **Privilege Escalation Checks**: Identifies vulnerable FTP versions (e.g., Microsoft FTP Service 5.0) and tests executable uploads (`.asp`, `.sh`).
- **FTP Bounce Attack Testing**: Probes `PORT` command vulnerabilities for indirect attacks.
- **Recursive Directory Spidering**: Crawls directories (depth ≤ 3), flagging sensitive files/directories (e.g., `passwd`, `/Windows`).
- **Vulnerability Scoring**: Scores targets (anonymous login: +1, sensitive items: +2, root access: +5, escalation: +4, FTP Bounce: +3; high-value ≥ 5).
- **Logging**: Saves results to `darkftp_report.txt` for analysis.
- **Cross-Platform**: Targets Linux (Pure-FTPd) and Windows (Microsoft FTP Service) servers.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Library: `colorama`

Install dependencies:

pip install colorama


### Download
Download `darkftp.py` from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ChillHackLab/DarkFTP/) or directly from the release page for free.

## Usage

1. **Prepare IP List**:
   - Create a file (e.g., `ips.txt`) with one IP address per line.

2. **Run DarkFTP**:
   ```bash
   python darkftp.py --file ips.txt
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - Terminal: Shows connection status (green), directories (yellow), vulnerabilities (red), and scores (magenta).
   - Log: Saves to `darkftp_report.txt`.
   - Summarizes high-value targets (score ≥ 5).


## Configuration

- **Sensitive Directories/Files**:
  - Edit `SENSITIVE_DIRS` and `SENSITIVE_FILES` in `darkftp.py`:
    ```python
    SENSITIVE_DIRS = ['/etc', '/root', '/Windows', '/Windows/System32', ...]
    SENSITIVE_FILES = ['passwd', 'shadow', 'config', 'credentials', ...]
    ```
- **Root Test Directories**:
  - Modify `ROOT_TEST_DIRS`:
    ```python
    ROOT_TEST_DIRS = ['/etc', '/root', '/Windows/System32', '/Windows']
    ```
- **Vulnerable Versions**:
  - Update `VULNERABLE_VERSIONS`:
    ```python
    VULNERABLE_VERSIONS = {
        'Microsoft FTP Service 5.0': ['CVE-2009-3023', 'Potential remote code execution'],
        ...
    }
    ```

## Ethical Use and Legal Disclaimer

**DarkFTP is for authorized penetration testing only.** Unauthorized scanning or exploitation violates laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Obtain explicit permission from system owners before use. Developers are not responsible for misuse.
